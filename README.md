# TourCMS_API_PHP
Test in PHP to consume the TourCMS API to show a list of tours that match with the region code of Spain [ES].

I have been separated the part of the code in HTML that shows the information that I consume from the API 
from the rest of the code, to improve the reading of the code, and do it more clean and improve the performance.
