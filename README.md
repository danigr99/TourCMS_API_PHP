# TourCMS_API_PHP
Test in PHP to consume the TourCMS API to show a list of tours that match with the region code of Spain [ES].

To see the final result you have to launch the "tours.php" file.

I have separated the part of the code in HTML that shows the information that I consume from the API 
from the rest of the code, to improve the reading of the code, and do it more clean and improve the performance.

Some tours shown in the final result have regions that doesn't match with the region that should be [ES], but the code
has been made to show only the results that belong to [ES] country.
